## Disclaimer
- Although the URL is public, sign-in is not permitted to everyone, as I must first get Spotify's permission to take data from any given user. I currently use this project along with 20 Beta Testers - thanks friends!

## Highlights 
- Built a web application using the Python-Flask framework integrated and hosted with Heroku
- Implemented dynamic querying through the Spotify API based on the userâ€™s created playlists
- Visualized insights with over 30 unique Plotly figures including bar charts, timelines, and box plots
  
- **Demo 1:** Features 5 Pages = Home, About Me, Currently Playing, Top 50, Search (Artists/Playlists)

- **Demo 2:** Currently Playing, Temporary Window Caching, Individual User Session Data
    - See stats of any song that's in any of your playlists!
    - Best when you're jamming to one of your own playlists, but also works if you're adding songs to a queue or listening to someone else's playlist.
    - If you close the window without logging out, you will have some time to reload the page without having to sign in and collect your data again
    - Others cannot access your data even if you forget to sign out
