## Accomplishments

- Utilized an ***open-source template*** and applied customization based off of creator's Github Issues and commits
- Recorded a ***knowledge base library*** with simple, useful information from prior approaches and results

## Motivations

- Provides a space for me to talk about the projects I've worked on as a hobby, and gives them a final resting place
- Lets me publish blog content for whenever I feel like writing
