## Highlights
- Finally made improvements to my first ever portfolio website from AP Computer Science Principles in high school 
- Provides a space for me to talk about the projects I've worked on as a hobby, and gives them a final resting place
- Serves as reminders on how I did something in the past so I can quickly re-learn if needed
- Lets me publish blog content for whenever I feel like writing about weird stuff
