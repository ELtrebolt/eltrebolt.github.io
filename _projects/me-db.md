- Although the URL is public, sign-in is not permitted to everyone, as I must first get Googleâ€™s permission to take data from any given user. I currently use this project along with 20 Beta Testers - thanks friends!

## Highlights
- Applied MERN stack to create a CRUD app that utilizes Google Oauth2 login with Passport JS and Cookie-Session
- Customized interface to display user-categorized rankings of shows, movies, and video games
- Implemented search filtering by year and tag with autocomplete suggestions based on input
