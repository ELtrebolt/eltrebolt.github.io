## My Story

I like to play the ukulele. I also like music on the radio, anime intros, tv theme songs, and the occasional dab when appropriate.

Combined, this is Ukudabs!

I post instrumentals, tutorials, and tabs using everything at my disposal â€“ ukuleles, a boxdrum (cajon), and the Internet mostly.

I will not rest until I have done right by all of my favorite tv shows by covering their theme songs. Up next: How I Met Your Mother

## Top 3 Favorites
*These are the ones I'm most proud of and likely to show people*
### 1. See You Again - Kobe Bryant Tribute

I think I'm most proud of this one because of the circumstances around it. The world lost a hero when Kobe Bryant died in February 2020, and anyone could see the impact felt around the world. For me, he wasn't an all-time idol because I was never such a big fan of basketball. But I am a big fan of sports. And his competitiveness, his Mamba Mentality, that's something that everyone admired about him no matter a sports fan or not. So I wanted to give tribute to him and of course his daughter, and I did so within the week because of how much it meant to me. Quotes are powerful, but Kobe Quotes... those just hit different now. 

### 2. Brooklyn Nine-Nine Theme Song

I am super happy with how this one turned out! Short and sweet, looks cool because I got the leather jacket and police badge, and sounds great thanks actually using a microphone to record the sound before recording video. The combined dab at the end feels great with the slow-mo. And like, I just think it's a bop.  

### 3. Community Theme Song

I wasn't expecting this one to feel so fun at first! There was a lot of things I could've done for the Community Theme Song that I actually ended up doing in Greendale Is Where I Belong instead, but the all-black Darkest Timeline goatee feels perfect to go along with Covid in 2020 at the time haha. The audio lacks a bit b/c of the static noise, but overall I'm super proud of it!

### Honorable Mention: One Piece We Are
Just wanna say I'm proud of this one because it was my first ever :\). This song (and particularly cover by noukenolife, whose video helped me learn how to play this) was one of the biggest inspirations for me to play the ukulele. 

## Top 3 Most Difficult
*These are the ones I'd never want to try to record again*
### 1. Some Nights

Man, oh man, I just remember how frustrated I was trying to finish this one. It's a long song man! And some of the parts were super fast for me to keep up with, and I messed up A LOT. Practically took me the whole day to get the melody right. 

### 2. Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BK_UHj3sjww?si=STdhLt3QCspg3u1u" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
Ohh boy this one was tough for both recording and editing! I was on a tight schedule having to record before the family road trip up to Grandma and Grandpa's before Christmas, and I wanted to post on Christmas day! I stayed up the night before we left to get just-good-enough footage and had to edit on a super-slow laptop when we got there. Just barely made it in time!

### 3. Viva la Vida / A Whole New World / One Piece We Are
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Db-BROGc1U?si=xAMAvrxPygPzSFiP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
One-shots are hard. I want to hit all the notes right and there's no other tracks to back me up. These 2 definitely took much longer to record than the rest of them. 

## Top 3 Underrated
*These are the ones with the least amount of views that I like the most*
### 1. Pokemon Center Theme Song
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LDnByw2Chvw?si=0jVSGPXw_8BakISw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
I totally didn't know what to film at first for this. But it's different! A little text magic and not-so-clear-cut camera angle is still better than just sitting and doing nothing. But uhh, not amazing, I know. 

### 2. Avatar the Last Airbender Theme Song
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihiMe76VqS4?si=KbMePJUTcAIaqhfo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
I kinda thought this one sounded pretty good and that there'd be more ATLA fans who'd look up ukulele covers. Owell.

### 3. Say You Won't Let Go

This was one of the first songs of mine that "blew up" - getting a couple hundred views within the first week was (and still is haha) a lot! I guess thanks, Dad, for showing all your work friends. But it never got more from there, and I really liked how this one turned out because I thought I was onto the coolness of the background chords + background melody + main melody.
