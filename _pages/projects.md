*This page is meant to show off the projects I've completed, the skills I used, and the features I've implemented. For info on how I built them (how-to tutorials) check out my blog posts!*

**My favorites**:
- **Spotify-Statys**: a Spotify stats website with over 30 unique visualizations about your created playlists
- **ME-DB**: a text-based Tier List web app for your favorite Anime, TV Shows, Movies, and Video Games

**Some stuff I want to work on**: 
- NFL Fantasy Football League Stats - historical head to head record, AVG Rank, etc.
- A Year Ago: a reflective note-taking app
