## What is ME-DB?
- ME-DB is your perfect ***Media Entertainment Database*** to keep track of all of your favorite shows, movies, games, and more!
- Organize your media by ***tiers***, separating your absolute favorites from your biggest regrets!
- Plan your ***To-Do List*** separate from your ***Collection***, filter by tags, and customize to your liking!

## Who is ME-DB for?
- The ***Planner*** who likes to decide what to do next by ranking their choices
- The ***Collector*** who likes to look at their own accomplishments

## How do you use ME-DB?
- ***Create***: click on the + button to create a Media Card in any tier you'd like with a title, description, and tags
- ***Organize***: drag and drop Media Cards freely to sort into tiers
- ***Customize***: double click on the tier title to customize its name
- ***Track***: view stats for your to-do lists and collections

## Why did you build ME-DB?
- ***I love keeping track of all of my favorite media*** - before I created this project I actually had separate Google Docs where I'd list them out in pages and gave each a score on how much I liked it.
> I needed a better way to both record the data and visualize it, not in separate Google Docs but all in one application, accessible from anywhere!

At the same time, with all of the new content coming out nowadays, ***I wanted to condense a To-Do List across multiple platforms***. Instead of keeping track of multiple Watch Lists on Netflix, Hulu, and the like, I could have one place that helps me decide what I most want to spend my time doing!
