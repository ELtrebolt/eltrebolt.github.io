## Astro Version (Current)
- ***Performance First***: Migrated to Astro to leverage its "Zero JS by default" architecture, resulting in lightning-fast load times.
- ***Component-Based***: Utilizes Astro components and layouts for a modular, maintainable codebase that's easy to extend.
- ***Content Collections***: Managed via Astro's built-in Content Collections API, ensuring type-safety for all blog posts and projects.
- ***Modern Styling***: Completely rebuilt the UI using Tailwind CSS for a unique, responsive, and accessible design.

## Jekyll Version (Old)
- ***Static Foundation***: Originally built using Jekyll, a Ruby-based static site generator.
- ***Open Source Template***: Leveraged the "Minimal Mistakes" theme, which provided a robust starting point for my portfolio.
- ***Learning Experience***: Taught me the basics of Liquid templating, Markdown-based content management, and deployment via GitHub Pages.
