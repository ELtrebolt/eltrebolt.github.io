## <i class="fas fa-dumbbell" style="color: #57595b;"></i> Athletics 
- Shoutout to **Soccer** <i class="fas fa-futbol" style="color: #1f512b;"></i>, my first team sport growing up, for *kickstarting* my love for active competition
- **American Football** <i class="fas fa-football-ball" style="color: #511f1f;"></i> excites me in a tremendous way, and ultimately is the sport I want to build a career in because of both its hype and team strategy mechanics
- **Tennis** <i class="fas fa-baseball-ball" style="color: #dff24a;"></i> is the sport I've continuously played the longest as part of high school varsity and college club teams. Shoutout to Rancho Bernardo High School [2018-2019 San Diego Division I Sectional Champs](https://www.instagram.com/rbhs_tennis/?hl=en) and the [UC Irvine Tennis Club](https://www.facebook.com/TennisClubatUCI/)!
- **Pickleball** <i class="fas fa-table-tennis" style="color: #0fcc84;"></i> I recently find myself playing more and more often instead of tennis!
- **Golf** <i class="fas fa-golf-ball" style="color: #c0c0c9;"></i> is a rare outing, but every now and then I'll hop over to a driving range and see how many swings it takes me to get the ball off the ground

- [Upbeat Alternative Rock](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0fXEEXQLRVRKN68i7iCmtI?si=1bd4cab161064d33) is my jam <i class="fas fa-headphones-alt" style="color: #f57d3d;"></i>
