        Hi there, I like playing guitar and ukulele, especially my favorite songs from tv shows and anime. Check out my YouTube channel for covers or tabs for how to play, and thanks for stopping by!

          I like to play the ukulele. I also like music on the radio, anime intros, tv theme songs, and the occasional dab when appropriate.

            I think I'm most proud of this one because of the circumstances around it. The world lost a hero when Kobe Bryant died in February 2020, and anyone could see the impact felt around the world. For me, he wasn't an all-time idol because I was never such a big fan of basketball. But I am a big fan of sports. And his competitiveness, his Mamba Mentality, that's something that everyone admired about him no matter a sports fan or not. So I wanted to give tribute to him and of course his daughter, and I did so within the week because of how much it meant to me. Quotes are powerful, but Kobe Quotes... those just hit different now.

            I am super happy with how this one turned out! Short and sweet and felt as cool as Peralta. It also sounds better thanks to actually using a real microphone. And like, I just think it's a bop.

            I wasn't expecting this one to be so fun at first! There was a lot of things I could've done for the Community Theme Song that I actually ended up doing in Greendale Is Where I Belong instead, but the all-black Darkest Timeline goatee feels perfect to go along with COVID in 2020 at the time haha. The audio lacks a bit b/c of the static noise, but overall I'm super proud of it!

            Just wanna say I'm proud of this one because it was my first cover :) This song (and particularly cover by noukenolife, whose video helped me learn how to play this) was one of the biggest inspirations for me to play the ukulele.
